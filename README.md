## Introduction
This project aims to provide accurate brain tumor segmentation using advanced U-Net architectures. By leveraging VGG16 as the encoder backbone, these models achieve high performance in medical image segmentation tasks.

## Models
The repository contains implementations of the following models:
- `VGG16_U-Net`: Standard U-Net with VGG16 encoder.
- `VGG16_Attention_U-Net`: U-Net with attention mechanism added to the VGG16 encoder.
- `VGG16_Scaler_Attention_U-Net`: U-Net with scaler attention blocks.
- `VGG16_MCA_U-Net`: U-Net with multi-scale channel attention.

## Dataset
The models were trained and evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of brain MRI images. We have created our own dataset combining it with different sources and based on that we have achieved our Results.
